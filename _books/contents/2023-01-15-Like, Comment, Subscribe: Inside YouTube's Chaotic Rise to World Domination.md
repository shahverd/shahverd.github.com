In this book, Mark Bergen who is a technology reporter at Bloomberg, tells the story of YouTube, from its early days as a college project to its current status as one of the most popular websites in the world.

Bergen provides a behind-the-scenes look at YouTube, drawing on interviews with the company's founders, executives, and creators. He chronicles the company's rapid growth, its struggles to deal with misinformation and extremism, and its impact on culture and society.

The book is well-written and engaging, and it provides a fascinating look at one of the most important companies of our time. Bergen does a good job of balancing the technical aspects of YouTube with the human stories of the people who created it.

Here are some of the things that Bergen covers in the book:

- The early days of YouTube, when it was just a college project by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim.
- The company's rapid growth, from its launch in 2005 to its acquisition by Google in 2006.
- The challenges that YouTube has faced, such as dealing with misinformation and extremism.
- The impact of YouTube on culture and society, such as the rise of "influencers" and the way that YouTube has changed the way we consume news and entertainment.
