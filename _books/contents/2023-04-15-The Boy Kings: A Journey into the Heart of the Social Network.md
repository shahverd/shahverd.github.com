This is a book by Katherine Losse, published in 2012. It is a memoir of Losse's time working at Facebook as employee number 51. Losse provides a behind-the-scenes look at the company's early days, from its founding by Mark Zuckerberg to its rapid growth into a global phenomenon.

The book is divided into three parts: 

- **The Boy Kings** introduces Losse and her fellow early employees at Facebook. Losse describes them as a group of brilliant but socially awkward young men who were driven to create a new kind of social network. 
- **The Network** describes the company's rapid growth and its impact on the world. Losse discusses how Facebook changed the way people communicate, connect, and share information. 
- **The End** explores the company's challenges and controversies. Losse discusses the privacy concerns raised by Facebook, as well as the company's role in the spread of misinformation.

**The Boy Kings** is a fascinating and insightful look at one of the most influential companies in the world. Losse's writing is engaging and her insights are sharp.
