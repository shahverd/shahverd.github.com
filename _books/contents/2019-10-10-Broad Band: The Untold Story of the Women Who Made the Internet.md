**Broad Band** is a book that tells the stories of the women who made the internet what it is today. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of technology or the role of women in society.

The book is divided into three parts:
- "The Making of the Internet"
- "The Rise of the Personal Computer"
- "The Internet and Society."

Each part of the book focuses on a different aspect of the history of the Internet, and how women have contributed to each aspect. The book is well-researched, and Evans does a good job of weaving together the personal stories of the women she profiles with the broader history of the Internet. The book is also well-written, and Evans's prose is clear and engaging. Broad Band is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of the Internet, or in the contributions of women to technology.
