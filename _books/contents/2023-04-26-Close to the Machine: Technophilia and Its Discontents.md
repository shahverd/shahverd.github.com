This is a book by Ellen Ullman about her experiences as a software engineer in Silicon Valley. The book explores the intersection of people and technology, the strange ecstasy of being at the forefront of the technological revolution, and the difficulty of translating the inherent messiness of human life into artful and efficient code.

Ullman writes with wit, candor, and insight, and she offers a nuanced portrait of the tech industry, showing both its promise and its perils. She is particularly good at capturing the sense of awe and wonder that can come from working with computers, as well as the frustration and alienation that can also arise.

Close to the Machine is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the tech industry, and it is also a valuable contribution to the literature of technology and the human condition.

Here are some of the themes that Ullman explores in the book:

- The allure of technology and the technophilia that often accompanies it.
- The difficulty of translating human thought and emotion into code.
- The challenges of working in a male-dominated industry.
- The impact of technology on our lives and our relationships.
- The ethical implications of technology.
- Close to the Machine is a thought-provoking and insightful book that offers a unique perspective on the tech industry and its impact on our world.
