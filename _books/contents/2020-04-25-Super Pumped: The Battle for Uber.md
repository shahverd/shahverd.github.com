As New York Times and Wall Street Journal **Bestseller**, The book covers the events between the founding of Uber in 2009 and its initial public offering in 2019. It is a must-read for anyone interested in Silicon Valley, the sharing economy, or the future of transportation.

*The book is divided into three parts*: 

 - **The Entrepreneur**: The first part tells the story of Garrett Camp, the original founder of Uber, and Travis Kalanick, the CEO who turned Uber into a global phenomenon. 
 - **The Company**: The second part explores the company's culture, which was often characterized by ruthless ambition and a disregard for the law. 
 - **The Battle**:The third part recounts the events leading up to Kalanick's ouster as CEO in 2017.

If you are interested in learning more about Uber or Silicon Valley, I highly recommend reading Super Pumped. It is a well-written and informative book that will give you a new perspective on these topics.
