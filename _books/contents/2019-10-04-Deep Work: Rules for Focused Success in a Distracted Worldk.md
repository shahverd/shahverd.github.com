Generally speaking, I don’t like the idea of self-help books, but I kind of needed to spend time on one, and it happened to be a book titled Deep Work.

The book is devided into two main parts: 1. explaining deep work 2. the way to work deeply

Newport describes deep work as: “Professsional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”; and this is contrasted with shallow work: “Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.”

If like me, you are one of those people who need to concentrate and stay focused, then this book is for you. It in the second part of the book, you can find some advises on how to stay focused and how to keep working without distraction. Its all about hard work, discipline, discipline and again disciplin.

I’m not saying that stuffs in this book are new ideas, as the book seems to be a very long blog post too. But sometimes you need to have them all together in one place, simple rules that you were following once, and now you find yourself not remembering the last time you kept doing them.
