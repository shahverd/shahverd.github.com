**Uncanny Valley** focuses on Wiener's transition from the publishing industry to a series of jobs at technology companies, and her gradual disillusionment with the technology industry. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the forces that are shaping our world today.

The book is divided into three parts:

- **The Valley**: chronicles Wiener's arrival in Silicon Valley and her early experiences working at a start-up.
- **The System**: explores the culture of Silicon Valley and the ways in which it shapes the people who work there.
- **The Future**: follows Wiener as she leaves Silicon Valley and reflects on her experiences.

Throughout the book, Wiener writes with wit, candor, and insight. She is unsparing in her criticism of the tech industry, but she is also fair-minded and empathetic. She gives a nuanced portrait of Silicon Valley, showing both its promise and its perils.

Uncanny Valley has been praised by critics for its sharp observations, its insightful analysis, and its personal and engaging style. It has been called "a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the tech industry" and "a cautionary tale for our times."

Here are some of the themes that Wiener explores in the book:

- The culture of Silicon Valley, with its emphasis on disruption, innovation, and growth at all costs.
- The power of the tech industry, and the ways in which it shapes our lives.
- The challenges of working in a male-dominated industry.
- The dangers of surveillance and data collection.
- The ethical implications of technology.
- Uncanny Valley is a timely and important book that provides a much-needed critical perspective on the tech industry.
